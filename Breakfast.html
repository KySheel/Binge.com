				<p>
					We all know breakfast is the most important meal of the day. But just 
					because you're aware that this meal is crucial doesn't mean you always 
					have time to whip up something delicious. From school drop-offs to busy 
					commutes to squeezing in a sweat session, weekday mornings can often be 
					our busiest time of day. Or, maybe you’re sick of your go-to toast or bagel 
					and need new, easy breakfast ideas. That’s what we’re here for: to provide 
					all the a.m. inspo you need, whether you’re craving healthy muffin recipes
					or easy egg recipes or healthy smoothie recipes to really power-up your day.

		<div class="content">
		<h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
		<hr>
		  <p><ul>
			  <li>7+ cups chicken broth</li>
			  <li>1 1/2 cups rice</li>
			  <li>1/2 to 1 cup prawns/shrimp</li>
			  <li>1 thumb-size piece ginger</li>
			  <li>Handful of fresh basil leaves</li>
			  <li>1/2 to 1 cup fresh coriander</li>
			  <li>3 spring onions</li>
			  <li>1 to 3 tbsp. fish sauce </li>
			</ul>
			<h2><strong>To Serve:</strong></h2>
			<hr>
			<ul>
			  <li>Optional: fresh red chilies </li>
			  <li>1 tbsp. soy sauce</li>
			  <li>1 tbsp. sesame oil</li>
			  <li>Dash of white pepper</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h2><strong>Steps:</strong></h2>
			<hr>
			<ol>
			  <li>Although you can make this recipe 
			  on the stove, it's easier to use a 
			  slow cooker (this way you won't have 
			  to keep checking on it, as it needs to 
			  cook quite a long time). Place broth and 
			  rice in a slow cooker on "high" (or "low" 
			  if cooking all day or overnight). Cover 
			  and allow to cook for at least 2 hours, 
			  or until rice is very soft. Tip: The rice
			  should lose a lot of its form so that it looks 
			  almost like cream of wheat,or very soft,
			  watery rice.
			</li>
			  
			  <li>Add prawns to the slow cooker for the last 5 to 10 minutes
			  - just long enough to cook them.</li>
			  
			  <li>If the soup becomes too thick, add a little more broth
			  or water.</li>
			  
			  <li>Add 1 tbsp. of the fish sauce plus the ginger, and stir. Do a 
			  taste test for saltiness, adding up to 2 Tbsp. more fish sauce if 
			  not salty enough. (If too salty, add 1-2 Tbsp. lime juice). Note:
			  Keep in mind that you'll be adding a little soy sauce to the soup
			  before eating, which will also add to the saltiness.</li>
			  
			  <li>Ladle into bowls and sprinkle with fresh coriander, basil,
			  and spring onion.</li>
			  
			  <li>Serve with pepper and the sauces mentioned above (red chili 
			  sauce or fresh cut red chili, soy sauce, and sesame oil), allowing 
			  your family or guests to add their own according to taste. (I usually 
			  add 1 to 2 tsp. soy sauce, 1/2 to 1 tsp. sesame oil, plus a little 
			  pepper to mine, for example.)</li>
			  
			  <li>Leftover Tip: This soup always thickens with time. When preparing 
			  the leftovers, simply heat up in a pot on the stove, adding as much 
			  broth as necessary to thin it out.</li>
			  
			  <li>If using whole grains: Just be aware they may have to cook a little 
			  longer than regular white rice. However, the taste is just as good. In fact, 
			  these days I always make this recipe with a mixture of brown and white rice 
			  plus whole grains like quinoa, buckwheat, etc...- it's delicious! </li>
