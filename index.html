			<h2 class="subtitlemid1">Fundamentals of Healthy Diet</h2>
			<p>
					While some extreme diets may suggest otherwise, we all need a balance of protein, 
					fat, carbohydrates, fiber, vitamins, and minerals in our diets to sustain a healthy 
					body. You don’t need to eliminate certain categories of food from your diet, but rather 
					select the healthiest options from each category.

					<strong>Protein</strong>.Gives you the energy to get up and go—and keep going—while also supporting mood 
					and cognitive function. Too much protein can be harmful to people with kidney disease, 
					but the latest research suggests that many of us need more high-quality protein, especially 
					as we age. That doesn’t mean you have to eat more animal products—a variety of plant-based 
					sources of protein each day can ensure your body gets all the essential protein it needs.

					diet can help improve your mood, boost your well-being, and even trim your waistline.

				<img class="imageleft" src="images/carbohydrates.jpg" alt="Carbohydrates"><p>
					<strong>Carbohydrates</strong>.are one of your body’s main sources of energy. But most should
					come from complex, unrefined carbs (vegetables, whole grains, fruit) rather than sugars and 
					refined carbs. Cutting back on white bread, pastries, starches, and sugar can prevent rapid 
					spikes in blood sugar, fluctuations in mood and energy, and a build-up of fat, especially 
					around your waistline.
